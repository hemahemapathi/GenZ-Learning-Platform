# GenZ-Learning Platform 

## Introduction

Welcome to the **Frontend of the E-Learning Platform**! This version of the platform is built using just **HTML** and **CSS** without any JavaScript frameworks. It allows users to browse courses, sign up, log in, and view course details.

## Features

### Student Features:
- **Browse Courses**: Students can browse through various courses offered on the platform.
- **View Course Details**: Each course provides details like description, instructor, and a list of lessons.

### Instructor Features:
- **Course Creation**: (Static for now, for demonstration purposes) View pages for course details, description, and instructor info.
- **Manage Courses**: Instructors can check course details with a predefined design (for demonstration).

## Tech Stack

- **HTML**: Structure of the pages (index.html).
- **CSS**: Styling for the pages (style.css).
- **No JavaScript**: No dynamic interaction for now (focus on static structure).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

No special prerequisites, just a browser to view the site. Optionally, a code editor for customization and development.


3. **Open in Browser**:

   - Open the `index.html` file in a browser (e.g., Google Chrome, Firefox, or Edge).
   - This will display the GenZ platform’s front-end static pages.

## File Descriptions

- **index.html**: Contains the static structure of the platform. This includes the homepage with sections like "Courses", "Sign Up", "Login", etc.
  
- **style.css**: Contains the basic styles for the platform, ensuring it has a simple yet responsive layout. You can add custom styles, colors, and fonts here.


## Customizing the Platform

To modify and enhance the frontend:

1. **Add More Pages**: Duplicate the existing structure to add more static pages (e.g., `about.html`, `contact.html`).
2. **Update Styles**: Customize the `style.css` file by changing fonts, colors, adding animations, and making it more visually appealing.
3. **Add New Sections**: Feel free to expand the layout by adding more sections under `index.html`, such as testimonials, instructors list, and featured courses.

## Deployment

For deployment, you can simply host your static files on a platform such as **GitHub Pages**, **Netlify**, or **Vercel**.

- **GitHub Pages**: Host the static HTML and CSS files directly from the repository.
- **Netlify**: Drag and drop the files into Netlify’s web interface for deployment.
